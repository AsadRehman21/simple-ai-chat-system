# Simple AI Chat System

This project implements a simple AI chat system that communicates with OpenAI's GPT-4 model using Flask.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the Simple AI Chat System up and running

1. `Clone the Repository:`

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/AsadRehman21/simple-ai-chat-system.git
    cd simple-ai-chat-system.git
    ```

2. `Create a Virtual Environment:`

    It is recommended to use Python 3.8 or higher. Please ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system. You can check the installed version with:

    ``` bash
    python --version  #or python3 --version
    ```

    If you're using Python 3, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands:

    ``` bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. `Install the Required Dependencies:`

    Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. `Set the OpenAI API Key:`

    In the root directory of your project, you will see a file called .env. If it's not there, create a new .env file.
    Open the .env file and paste your OpenAI API key in the following format:

    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

    Replace "your-api-key-here" with your actual OpenAI API key. Do not commit this file to your repository for security reasons.

5. `Run the Flask Application:`

    Once your environment is set up, start the Flask app by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python app.py # or python3 app.py
    ```

6. `Open the Application:`

    In your browser, open <http://localhost:5000> to access the chat system and start interacting with the AI.

    How the System Works

    Frontend: The HTML page contains a form where users can input their queries.

    Backend: The Flask app receives the query, sends it to OpenAI’s GPT-4 API, and returns the AI's response to the frontend.

    OpenAI API: The OpenAI API generates responses based on the user’s query using the GPT-4 model.

    Response Display: The frontend dynamically displays the model's response beneath the input field.

## Important Notes

1. `API Key Management`

    Make sure to not hardcode your OpenAI API key into the code. It should be stored securely as an environment variable or in the .env file as described above.

    Add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being pushed to version control

2. `Python Version`

    This project requires Python 3.8 or higher. We recommend using Python 3.8 or higher for compatibility with the libraries used in this project.

    To ensure you have the correct Python version, you can check it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```bash
    python --version  # or python3 --version
    ```

    If you do not have Python 3 installed, you can download and install it from the official website: Python Downloads.

3. `Virtual Environment`

    Using a virtual environment ensures that all dependencies are isolated from your global Python installation. If you are not familiar with virtual environments, you can refer to this guide: Python Virtual Environment Guide.

## Testing the System
To test the system, follow these steps:

1. Start the Flask application by running

```bash
python app.py. #or python3 app.py if your current python version is 3
```

2. Open the web application at <http://localhost:5000> in your browser.
3. Submit a query using the input field and click the submit button.
4. View the response generated by the model, which will appear beneath the input field.

## Enhancements (Optional)

Here are some potential future enhancements you might consider adding:

. `User Authentication:` Implement user authentication and session management for tracking conversations.

. `Frontend Enhancements`: Use JavaScript or a frontend framework like React to enhance  the UI/UX.

. `Error Logging:` Enhance error handling and logging for better monitoring of the system.

. `Unit Tests`: Write unit tests for the backend API to ensure reliability and performance.

## Code Structure

Here’s an overview of the project structure:

```bash
/SimpleAIChatSystem
    /app.py                # Flask backend application
    /config.py             # Configuration file for API key
    /templates
        /index.html       # Simple HTML page for user interaction
    /static                # Directory for static files (CSS, JS, images)
        /css
            /style.css   # Your CSS file(s)
        /js
            /app.js     # Your JavaScript file(s)
    /requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
    /.env                 # Environment file for API key
    /README.md            # This README file
```

## How to Set Your OpenAI API Key

Open or Create a .env file in the root of your project with the following content:

OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

Alternatively, for Linux/MacOS, set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable by running:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

For Windows, set the API key using the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

This ensures your application communicates securely with the OpenAI API.

## Final Notes

Ensure that the project is kept simple and easy to use. The goal of this project is to integrate the OpenAI API with Flask and provide a basic user interface.

## Python Version Compatibility

Required Python Version: 3.8 or higher.
Ensure you are using Python 3.x and a virtual environment for smooth setup and dependency management.
